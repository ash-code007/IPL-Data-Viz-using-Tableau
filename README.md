# IPL-Data-Viz-using-Tableau

The Indian Premier League, or IPL, is a T20 cricket league, which was founded in 2008 and is held every year. It sees participation from both national and international players, and eight teams representing eight Indian cities compete with each other in a double round-robin format in the league stages, which are followed by playoffs. Over the years, IPL has become one of the most-watched and most attended live sporting events all over the world.

Our work as a data analyst is to build a Tableau dashboard of IPL statistics over the years since its inception in order to create an infographic for a newsletter. For this newsletter, in some cases, they will use the visual representations as you have created in Tableau directly for their infographic, and in a few other cases, they will use important statistics after trying out the different filters and customizations that we have provided for interactivity. Therefore, we are expected to build an interactive dashboard in Tableau for this purpose.

1. Match Statistics

- Toss outcome vs Match outcome (for each Ground/Venue)
- Biggest wins (by runs and by wicket)
- Highest totals (across all the seasons)


2. Player Statistics

- Orange Cap contenders (The batsmen who have scored the maximum number of runs in a particular season)
- Purple Cap contenders (The bowlers who have taken the maximum number of wickets in a particular season)
- Batsmen who have hit the most number of fours and sixes (per season and overall)

3. Team Statistics
- Season-wise team performance (wins vs losses)
- Win %age ( home vs away)
